# WORK IN PROGRESS — VUIIS Center for Computational Imaging

[VUIIS CCI XNAT](https://xnat4.vandyxnat.org/xnat/) is operated by the VUIIS Center for Computational Imaging (VUIIS CCI) as part of the Human Imaging Core. The CCI is directed by [Baxter Rogers](https://vuiis.vumc.org/bio/baxter.rogers).

Please note that our pipeline documentation is moving here to github/readthedocs. If you find any pages that are out of date, please start a thread on the google group ([https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vuiis-cci](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vuiis-cci)). We want to keep everything up to date!
